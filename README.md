# chess-game 🚦
<h3>A second year university c++ game project. ♟️</h3>
<p>C++ is a powerful & an interesting language to work with. Although a bit harder, I liked tinkering with it when I had been writing this chess game. Woo!
It was made in Visual Studio IDE, but recently rediscovered & reviewed in Xcode.</p>

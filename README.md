# chess-game 🏁
<h3>A second year university c++ game project. ♟️</h3>
<p>I primarily found some base code on YouTube for this and then worked on top of that.</p>
<p>C++ is a powerful and an interesting language to work with. Although a bit harder, I liked tinkering with it when I had been writing this chess game. It was made in Visual Studio IDE, but recently was rediscovered and reviewed in Xcode.</p>
<p>I've included std namespace in header files. I know It's bad practice, but this is a small project and I didn't really thought about it back when I made it. </p>
